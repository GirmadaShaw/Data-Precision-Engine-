# Introduction


This repository contains a series of projects focused on different aspects of SQL. Each project includes data scraping, data cleaning, and sophisticated SQL queries to derive meaningful insights.


# Projects Overview

## 1. Data Science Job Market Analysis

### Description

In this project, data on the data science job market was scraped from various job boards. The dataset was cleaned and processed, followed by the execution of multiple SQL queries to uncover trends and insights in the job market.

### Data Collection

Source: Various job boards
Tools Used: Python (BeautifulSoup, Requests), Pandas

- Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Removing duplicates

### SQL Queries
Concepts Used: 
- JOINS
- CTEs
- Sub-queries
- Window functions

Example Queries:
```bash
SELECT jobs.title, companies.name, salaries.amount
FROM jobs
JOIN companies ON jobs.company_id = companies.id
JOIN salaries ON jobs.salary_id = salaries.id
WHERE salaries.amount > 100000;
```
### Insights
- Key job market trends
- Trends in salaries

  

## 2. [Google Play Store Analysis](#Google_Play)
